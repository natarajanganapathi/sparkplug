# SparkPlug

SparkPlug is an open-source project that provides a set of reusable components and templates for building web applications using ASP.NET Core and Angular. The project aims to simplify and speed up the development of web applications by providing a comprehensive set of tools and guidelines for building modern, scalable, and maintainable applications.

The SparkPlug project includes several modules that provide functionality for common web application features such as authentication, authorization, logging, error handling, caching, and more. The modules are designed to be easy to use and can be easily integrated into new or existing web applications.

In addition to the modules, SparkPlug also provides a set of starter templates that can be used as a starting point for new web applications. The templates include preconfigured settings for the modules, as well as sample code and documentation to help developers get up and running quickly.
